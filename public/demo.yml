    #### ABX Demo

    This is a demo listening test showing how ABX listening tests app works from the listener's perspective.

    In this test suite you'll go through three different tests, two ABX tests and one AB test. In each one you'll be
    given three different options with different compression methods. In the ABX tests your task is to figure out which
    of the options is the same as X and in the AB test you need to select your preferred option.

    You'll see your results at the end. It would also be possible to have the test send the results to
    the researcher by supplying an email in the configuration file but this demo test does not do so. The form
    below is an example of what can be done to gather statistics about the different demographics. The
    email sent to the research would also include the form data.
  form:
    - name: Age
